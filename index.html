<h3>
  More on this important fight
</h3>
<p>
  When it launched in January 2015, IDNYC’s supporters saw it as an important way to reach out to and connect with immigrant communities and undocumented residents in the city. The program had the support of religious and civic leaders, activist groups and even the NYPD. Modeled on similar programs across the country—from New Haven to Los Angeles and San Francisco—IDNYC quickly became the largest such program in the country. Six months into the program, more than 400,000 people had enrolled, and by now almost 900,000 IDs have been issued, giving many people access to crucial basic services. New York is also the first city with a municipal ID program that permits applicants to self-identify their genders. The success of IDNYC has encouraged other cities to look into their own programs.
  From the beginning, however, there were questions about both the use to which the data could be put and the degree to which vulnerable populations would therefore be willing to step out of the shadows to obtain IDs. The ACLU cautioned that any security measures could be subject to lawsuits. But the benefits of the program and the security protocols put in place by the city overshadowed these concerns for many.
  Few foresaw, however, the political earthquake of the recent presidential election that would thrust issues such as sanctuary cities, DACA or IDNYC into the spotlight; few thought anti-immigrant voices would be so quickly emboldened.
  A New York State assemblymember who represents Bay Ridge and Staten Island, Nicole Malliotakis, has co-filed a lawsuit with assemblymember Ron Castorina to prevent the mayor’s office from destroying data accumulated by the city’s municipal ID program, known as IDNYC, primarily designed to offer identification to undocumented immigrants. IDNYC allows for applicants’ data to be destroyed, an effective kill switch designed to keep such information out of the hands of an anti-immigrant administration.

  The lawsuit has renewed the concerns of program supporters and immigrant-rights activists that the information could be used for the purposes of deportation; the lawsuit arrived shortly after an election determined in part by anti-immigrant fervor. Castorina, who supported Trump and still supports his proposed wall along the U.S. border, was quick to dismiss these concerns as “fearmongering.” Instead, he said, the lawsuit was motivated by security concerns, not immigration issues; he said people might use the ID cards in “a way where nefarious conduct may certainly ensue”—engaging in his own fearmongering! (Malliotakis, who supported Rubio in the primaries, was silent about Trump leading up to the election.)
  With the personal data of almost 900,000 applicants now at stake, this has the potential to do permanent damage to the program, both because the city now might have to break its word to applicants but also because of the cloud of terror and criminality that now stigmatizes a swath of the populace.
